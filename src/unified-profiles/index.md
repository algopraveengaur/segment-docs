Unified Profiles in Flex, available with Twilio's [Agent Copilot](https://www.twilio.com/docs/flex/customer-ai){:target="_blank"}, provides your Flex agents with real-time customer data from multiple enterprise systems within Flex. Agents can view each customer's details and a historical timeline that shows a customer's previous activities, enabling agents to provide personalized support based on a customer's history.

To try out Agent Copilot, which includes Unified Profiles for Flex, request access from the [CustomerAI for Contact Center](https://console.twilio.com/us1/develop/flex/customerai/overview){:target="_blank"} page in your Flex Console. Agent Copilot is currently in beta and access is limited. After you sign up, a Twilio Flex team member will contact you by email.
