## Using the Plugin in your App

Open the file where you setup and configure the Analytics-Swift library. Add this plugin to the list of imports.

Your events will now begin to flow to Survicate in device mode.

### Using the SurvicateDestination plugin

#### Identify

In the SurvicateDestination plugin, the Identify event from Segment is transferred to the setUserTrait method of Survicate. This is achieved within the identify function of the SurvicateDestination class. The traits and userId from the Identify event are extracted and set as user traits in Survicate using the setUserTrait method. The traits are a dictionary where each key-value pair is set as a user trait. The userId is also set as a user trait with the key "userId".

#### Track

In the SurvicateDestination plugin, the Track method from Segment is used as the invokeEvent method in Survicate. This means that when you track an event in Segment, it will be invoked in Survicate.

#### Screen

Similarly, the Screen method from Segment is used as the enterScreen method in Survicate. This means that when you track a screen in Segment, it will be entered in Survicate.

#### Reset

The reset method from Segment is used as the reset method in Survicate. This means that when you reset the user in Segment, it will be reset in Survicate.
