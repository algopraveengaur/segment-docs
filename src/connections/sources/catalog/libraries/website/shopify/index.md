Use the Shopify Source with the Twilio Segment Shopify App to send user analytics events from your Shopify Store to Segment. 

The Twilio Segment Shopify App sends [Shopify Web Pixel API Standard Events](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/web-pixels-api/standard-events){:target="_blank"} from your Shopify Store to the Segment Shopify Source as [Segment Ecommerce Spec](/docs/connections/spec/ecommerce/v2/) events. 

## Overview

#### This document contains instructions for the following: 
1. Steps to create a Shopify Source.
2. Steps to install and configure the Twilio Segment Shopify App to your Shopify Store. 
3. Steps to add the Segment Javascript snippet to your Shopify theme.liquid template. This is optional and is only required if you wish for events to be populated with the anonymousId created by a Segment Javascript snippet.  

After the App is installed and enabled in the Shopify Store events will be sent from the user's browser to your Segment Shopify Source in real time. 

#### How the App works:  
- Once enabled, the Twilio Segment App loads a custom JavaScript mapping script to your Shopify store. As users navigate the Store website the script transforms Shopify Standard Events to Segment Ecommerce Spec events and sends them to your Shopify Source in Segment.
- All events are transmitted directly from the browser to Segment. This is a Device Mode Integration, so no data is sent server-side from Shopify to Segment.  
- The Twilio Segment App does not load the Segment Javascript snippet onto your Shopify Store for you. You can optionally add the snippet to your Store's theme.liquid template so that the anonymousId can generated by the snippet can be sent in events sent by the App to Segment. 

#### The App offers settings for the following:
- To select which Segment events to send to Segment.
- To specify how user profile details should be sent to Segment.
- To specify which value to use as the anonymousId in event payloads.

If you require more advanced functionality or want to collect post-purchase events, consider using the [Shopify by Littledata](/docs/connections/sources/catalog/libraries/website/shopify-littledata/) or [Segment - Powered by Fueled](https://segment.com/docs/connections/sources/catalog/cloud-apps/shopify-fueled/) Sources. These Sources require a paid subscription. 

## Getting Started

#### Create a Shopify Source (required)

1. **Log in** to your Segment Workspace.
2. Click on 'Catalog'. 
3. Use the 'Search an Integration' search field to search for the term 'Shopify'.
4. Select the 'Shopify' tile and complete the steps to set it up. Do not select the 'Shopify (by Littledata)' or 'Shopify - powered by Fueled' tiles as these are for other Sources.  
5. Make a note of the Source's [**Write Key**](/docs/connections/find-writekey/).   

#### Install the Twilio Segment App on your Shopify Store (required) 

1. **Log in** to the [Admin section](https://admin.shopify.com/) for your Shopify Store.
2. Go to the [Shopify app store listing](https://apps.shopify.com/twilio-segment){:target="\_blank"} and search for **Twilio Segment**.
3. Click **Add app** to begin the installation process.
4. Once the App has been installed, paste in the [**Write Key**](/docs/connections/find-writekey/) from your Segment Source and select the Region for your Segment Workspace. 
5. Use the checkboxes under 'Manage Events' to select which `track()` events to send to Segment. 
6. Use the checkboxes under 'Manage user profile details' to select how user profile details should be sent to Segment. Do not turn on your App yet. 

#### Optional: Add the Segment Javascript snippet to your Shopify Store's <head> tag: 
By default the Twilio Segment App will send a Shopify Client ID as the Segment anonymousId in events sent to Segment. However the App can be confgured to use an anonymousId generated by a Segment Javascript snippet. To do this the Segment Javascript snippet from your Source must to be included in the <head> tag of the Shopify Store's theme.liquid template. If you are happy with the Shopify Client ID being used you can skip these steps.     

1. In your Segment Workspace: navigate to the Shopify Source you created earlier.
2. Click the **Copy Snippet** button to copy the Segment Javascript snippet code. 
![Copy the Javascript snippet](images/js_snippet.png)
3. In your Shopify Store Admin: Edit the theme.liquid template file and paste the Javascript from step 2 just below the <head> tag. Save the file. 
![Add the Segment Javascript snippet to the <head> tag](images/add_snippet_to_shopify_theme.png)
4. In the Twilio Segment App: Select "Use Segment Cookie" from the **Anonymous Id value** dropdown then click the **Save Changes** button.

#### Turn on the App to start sending events

1. To start sending analytics events click the **Turn on** button in the Twilio Segment App. 
2. Analytics events will start flowing to your Segment Source as users navigate your Shopify Store.

## Identifiers

### anonymousId
By default, events sent from the Twilio Segment App will contain an anonymousId field with the value of a Shopify Client Id. Alternatively am `anonymousId` generated by a Segment Javascript snippet can be used if a Segment Javascript Snippet is added into the <head> tag of your Shopify Store template. Once this has been done, set the **Anonymous Id value** dropdown value to be "Use Segment Cookie" in the Twilio Segment App.   

### userId
The Twilio Segment App will not populate the `userId` field in events sent from Shopify. 

## Traits

### email, phone and other user traits 
Use the **Manage user profile details** section in the Twilio Segment App to specify how email, phone and other traits are sent to Segment.

## Sending user profile details to Segment

User profile details can be sent to Segment in 3 ways: 
1. As `traits` in Identify events.
2. As `properties` in Track events. 
3. As `traits` in Track events, included in the `context.traits` object.

User profile details are only sent to Segment when the following track events are triggered by Shopify:

## FAQs

### Why don't I see all of my events?
This Source uses client-side Javascript to send data to Segment. As with any client-side analytics tracking, some ad-blockers prevent data from being sent to Segment. This can lead to an under reporting of events to Segment. For more information about data loss associated with ad blockers, see the [Ad Blocking](/docs/connections/sources/catalog/libraries/website/javascript/#ad-blocking) documentation. 

### When do Identify events trigger?
To send Identify events, you must select the 'Send identify() calls' checkbox. If this setting is selected, Identify events are triggered when `Checkout Started`, `Address Info Entered`, `Shipping Info Entered`, `Contact Info Entered`, `Payment Info Entered` or `Order Completed` Track calls are triggered.

### Why aren't my Identify events triggering when expected?
To save on API call volume, Segment only triggers an Identify event when user profile details have changed. If no change is detected, then the Identify call is not triggered.  

### Why are some events duplicated and triggered multiple times?
Shopify sometimes erroneously triggers duplicate `Address Info Entered`, `Shipping Info Entered`, `Contact Info Entered`, `Payment Info Entered` events in short succession. This is a known bug with Shopify. Segment deduplicates the majority of these duplicate events but is unable to filter all of them out. 

### Why do some Address/Shipping/Contact/Payment Info Entered events contain product arrays?
Shopify sometimes includes product array details in [Standard Events](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/web-pixels-api/standard-events){:target="_blank"} which Segment uses to populate the `Address Info Entered`, `Shipping Info Entered`, `Contact Info Entered`, `Payment Info Entered` events. Segment includes these product details in Segment events.

### Why are some event properties missing even though the documentation indicates that they should be present?
Mapping code is in place to map the majority of valuable fields from Shopify's [Standard Events](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/web-pixels-api/standard-events){:target="_blank"} to Segment events. If properties are missing, it is due to the values not being provided by the Shopify event.
