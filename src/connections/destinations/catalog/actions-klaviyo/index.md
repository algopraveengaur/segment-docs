[Klaviyo](https://www.klaviyo.com){:target="_blank"} is a powerful email platform focused on ecommerce that helps companies make more money. It supports segmentation based on category and event triggers like product bought, page viewed, email engagement, or amount spent.

It measures opens, clicks, revenue generated, breakdown of generated revenue based on custom attributes (like campaign type or amount gained per recipient), and provides trend reports, cohort analysis, and subscriber growth.

Klaviyo lets you send personalized newsletters, automates triggered emails, product recommendations, welcome campaigns, order announcements, push notifications, and syncs your data to Facebook custom audiences.

2. Click **Create List/Segment**.
3. Choose **List**.
4. Give your list a name and add any applicable tags.
5. Click **Create List**.

## Using Klaviyo with Engage

Klaviyo (Actions) Destination can accept your [Engage](/docs/engage/) data.

1. Create and configure your Engage Audience.
2. Navigate to **Engage > Engage Settings > Destinations** and click **Add Destination**.
3. Select **Klaviyo (Actions) Audiences**.
4. Select your Audience Space as the source, and name your destination.

6. Click **Save** and make sure to enable the mapping.
7. On the **Mappings** tab, click **Add Mapping** and select **Remove Profile from List (Engage)**.
8. Click **Save** and make sure you enable the mapping.
9. Enable the destination.
10. On the **Engage > Audiences > (your audience)** page, click **Add Destination** and select the destination created.
11. In the settings that appear in the side panel, toggle the **Send Track** option on, and don't change the **Audience Entered/Audience Exited** event names.
12. Click **Save Settings**.

If you're encountering rate limiting issues, consider enabling batching for the Action receiving these errors. Ensure that within the mapping configuration, "Batch data to Klaviyo" is set to "Yes". This adjustment can help alleviate the rate limiting problem.
