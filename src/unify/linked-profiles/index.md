Use Linked Profiles to expand your model beyond the profile to the entire universe of business data. Linked Profiles offers a suite of products which includes the [Data Graph](/docs/unify/linked-profiles/data-graph/), [Linked Events](/docs/unify/linked-profiles/linked-events/), and [Linked Audiences](/docs/engage/audiences/linked-audiences/). 

Build a [Data Graph](/docs/unify/linked-profiles/data-graph/) that defines relationships between any data set in the warehouse and the Segment Profiles you send with Profiles Sync. 

You can then enrich your event streams with [Linked Events](/docs/unify/linked-profiles/linked-events/) and build advanced audiences and segmentation off of any data set you've mapped to the Data Graph with [Linked Audiences](/docs/engage/audiences/linked-audiences/).


Using Linked Profiles, you only need to define the relationships between data sets once in order to make this data accessible to marketers and business stakeholders to build targeted and personalized customer engagements.
